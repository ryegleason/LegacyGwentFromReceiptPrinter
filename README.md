# LegacyGwentFromReceiptPrinter
Prints proxies for card games using a receipt printer.

I use a TEROW T5890K for printing (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081SJTJ5G). Note that the python-escpos library used for printing is linux-exclusive, so your server must be a linux machine.

To start, run `python3 ./web/netcode.py`
